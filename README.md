# 🚀 Oasis InfoByte Java Programming Internship Tasks 🚀

Welcome to the Oasis InfoByte Java Programming Internship! 🎉 During my time as an intern at Oasis InfoByte, I had the chance to dive into some awesome Java projects. Let's explore the cool stuff I worked on! 😎

## 1) Number Guessing Game 🎮
- **Description:** Think you're good at guessing? This project is all about creating a Java-based number guessing game. Players have just 3 tries to guess the secret number, and they can use only 1 hint. It's a fun challenge that puts your Java skills to the test!

- **Key Features:**
  - Limited attempts (3 tries).
  - Hint system (1 hint allowed).
  - Interactive user interface.


## 2) ATM Interface 💰
- **Description:** Feeling like you need an ATM on your computer? The ATM Interface project is a Java-based ATM simulation. You can perform all the classic ATM operations, like checking account balances, withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and transferring money between accounts.

- **Key Features:**
  - Check account balance.
  - Withdraw and deposit funds.
  - Transfer money between accounts.
  - User authentication for security.

## Getting Started 🚀
If you're itching to dive into these projects or use them as inspiration for your own Java adventures, you're in luck! Check out the source code and documentation in the repositories linked below:
