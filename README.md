# 🚀 Codsoft Java Programming Internship Tasks 🚀

Welcome to the Codsoft Java Programming Internship! 🎉 During my time as an intern at Codsoft, I had the chance to dive into some awesome Java projects. Let's explore the cool stuff I worked on! 😎

## 1) Number Guessing Game 🎮
- **Description:** Think you're good at guessing? This project is all about creating a Java-based number guessing game. Players have just 3 tries to guess the secret number, and they can use only 1 hint. It's a fun challenge that puts your Java skills to the test!

- **Key Features:**
  - Limited attempts (3 tries).
  - Hint system (1 hint allowed).
  - Interactive user interface.

## 2) Student Grade Calculator 📚
- **Description:** Ever wanted a slick way to calculate student grades? The Student Grade Calculator is here for you. This Java program lets you input student info, like names and scores, and calculates their grades based on predefined criteria.

- **Key Features:**
  - Input student information.
  - Calculate grades based on specified criteria.
  - User-friendly interface for data entry.

## 3) ATM Interface 💰
- **Description:** Feeling like you need an ATM on your computer? The ATM Interface project is a Java-based ATM simulation. You can perform all the classic ATM operations, like checking account balances, withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and transferring money between accounts.

- **Key Features:**
  - Check account balance.
  - Withdraw and deposit funds.
  - Transfer money between accounts.
  - User authentication for security.
